== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Dribbble importer work? =

The plugin sets a transient that expires every hour. It will check against this transient to see if it should look at your dribbble feed and see if it needs to import any posts.

If it does, it will create `jetpack-portfolio` posts for items that don't exist. It will also create two post meta key/values:

- `dribbble_link_url`: which holds the URL for the shot on dribbble
- `dribbble_image_url`: which holds the URL for the image src for the shot

= How do I use the portfolio shortcode? =

Shortcode options:

‘display_types': display Project Types. (true/false)
‘display_tags': display Project Tags. (true/false)
‘display_content': display project content. (true/false)
‘include_type': display specific Project Types. Defaults to all. (comma-separated list of Project Type slugs)
‘include_tag': display specific Project Tags. Defaults to all. (comma-separated list of Project Tag slugs)
‘columns': number of&nbsp;columns in shortcode. Defaults to 2. (number, 1-6)
‘showposts': number of projects to display. Defaults to all. (number)

Shortcode example:

[portfolio display_types=true display_tags=false include_type=ui-design,app-design columns=3 showposts=10]
